## Tech Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

## To Run Locally

First, install the dependancies:

```bash
npm install
```

You'll also need the environment variables to create the Supabase client.

Then, to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
